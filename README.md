# Project Readme: googlerun-react-chatsystem

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive chat system featuring a React frontend and a Python (FastAPI) backend. It integrates various Google Cloud services for enhanced functionalities, including real-time chat, user authentication, image generation, speech-to-text transcription, geocoding services, and advanced batch audio processing with Whisper.

The system is designed with a modular architecture, separating concerns for the frontend, backend, batch processing, and shared utilities. Configuration is managed through environment files, and Docker is utilized for containerizing backend and batch processing components.

## 2. Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

* `backend/`: Contains the FastAPI backend application. [cite: 1]
* `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend application. [cite: 1]
* `whisper_batch/`: Houses the batch processing application for audio transcription using Whisper. [cite: 21]
* `common_utils/`: Provides shared utility modules used across different parts of the project, such as logging and GCP emulator management. [cite: 9, 37]
* `tests/`: Includes various test scripts, particularly for backend services and GCP emulator interactions. [cite: 21]
* Root directory: Contains project-wide configuration files (`pytest.ini`), utility scripts (`code_printer.py`, `tree.py`), and Docker-related files. [cite: 1]

## 3. Backend (`backend/`)

The backend is a FastAPI application responsible for handling API requests from the frontend and orchestrating various services. [cite: 2, 178]

## 5. Whisper Batch Processing (`whisper_batch/`)

This component handles asynchronous, long-running audio transcription and diarization tasks using Whisper models.

### 5.1. Functionality

* **Job Processing (`app/main.py`)**: The main script that polls Firestore for new transcription jobs, downloads audio from GCS, performs transcription using `faster-whisper`, and speaker diarization using `pyannote.audio`. [cite: 23, 1883, 1885, 1856]
* **Transcription (`app/transcribe.py`)**: Contains the logic for audio transcription using the WhisperModel. [cite: 23, 1918]
* **Diarization (`app/diarize.py`)**: Handles speaker diarization using `pyannote.audio.Pipeline`. [cite: 22, 1868]
* **Results Combination (`app/combine_results.py`)**: Merges the transcription and diarization outputs into a single JSON file with speaker-labeled segments. [cite: 22, 1859]
* **Storage**: Uses Google Cloud Storage for storing audio files and transcription results. [cite: 1885, 1901] Job metadata and status are managed in Firestore. [cite: 1883, 1886]

### 5.2. Configuration and Deployment

* Configuration is managed via `.env` files in `whisper_batch/config/` and `whisper_batch/config_develop/`. [cite: 23, 1925, 1926]
* It is designed to be run as a Docker container, with `whisper_batch.dockerfile` provided for building the image. [cite: 22] This Docker image is intended for use with GCP Batch.
* Requires a HuggingFace authentication token (`HF_AUTH_TOKEN`) for `pyannote.audio`. [cite: 1925]

## 6. Common Utilities (`common_utils/`)

This directory contains Python modules shared across the backend and potentially other Python-based components.

* **`logger.py`**: A centralized logging utility, configurable via the `DEBUG` environment variable, with features for data sanitization (masking sensitive keys, truncating long data). [cite: 111, 613, 615]
* **`class_types.py`**: Defines Pydantic models for request and data structures used throughout the application, ensuring data validation and type safety. [cite: 38, 526]
* **`gcp_emulator.py`**: Provides an `EmulatorManager` class and specific implementations for Firestore (`FirestoreEmulator`) and GCS (`GCSEmulator`) emulators. [cite: 537, 541, 552] This is primarily used for local development and testing to simulate GCP services. The GCS emulator uses Docker (`fsouza/fake-gcs-server`) and supports persistent data storage. [cite: 65, 553, 555]
* **`test_gcp_emulator.py`**: Contains Pytest tests for the GCP emulator utilities. [cite: 37]

## 7. Testing (`tests/`)

The project includes a `tests/` directory for automated tests.

* **Backend Tests (`tests/app/`)**:
    * `firebase_t.py`: Appears to be a script for testing Firebase/Firestore interactions, including creating and clearing test data. [cite: 20, 1739]
    * `tests_whisper_batch.py`, `tests_whisper_batch2.py`, etc.: A suite of tests for the `whisper_batch` functionality, likely covering job picking, timeout handling, and processing logic using a combination of mocks and a Firestore emulator. [cite: 21, 1794, 1808, 1822, 1835, 1845]
* **GCP Emulator Tests (`common_utils/test_gcp_emulator.py` and `tests/app/gcp_emulator_run.py`):**
    * `common_utils/test_gcp_emulator.py`: Unit and integration tests for the `FirestoreEmulator` and `GCSEmulator` classes using Pytest fixtures and context managers. [cite: 128, 134, 1713, 1725]
    * `tests/app/gcp_emulator_run.py`: A script to run Firestore and GCS emulators locally for development and testing purposes, with options to initialize data. [cite: 21, 144] It uses the `gcp_emulator.py` utility. [cite: 144]
* **Configuration**: `pytest.ini` files are present in the root directory, `backend/`, and `whisper_batch/` to configure Pytest behavior for each respective part of the project. [cite: 1, 2, 22, 160, 177, 1855]

## 8. Setup and Running

### 8.1. Environment Configuration

* The application relies heavily on environment variables for configuration.
* Backend: `.env` files in `backend/config/` and `backend/config_develop/` (e.g., `backend/config_develop/.env.develop`). [cite: 7, 525]
* Whisper Batch: `.env` files in `whisper_batch/config/` and `whisper_batch/config_develop/` (e.g., `whisper_batch/config_develop/.env.develop`). [cite: 23, 1925, 1926]
* Frontend: `.env.local` file in `frontend/` for Vite environment variables (e.g., Firebase API keys, API base URL). [cite: 10]

### 8.2. Backend

1.  Set up the required environment variables in `backend/config_develop/.env.develop` or a production `.env` file.
2.  The backend can be run directly using `python -m app.main` (likely after installing dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`). [cite: 176]
3.  Alternatively, build and run the Docker container defined in `backend/backend_frontend.dockerfile`, which also serves the frontend. [cite: 176] Refer to `gcloud_commandä¾‹.txt` for deployment examples on Google Cloud Run. [cite: 159]

### 8.3. Frontend

1.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory. [cite: 9]
2.  Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.local.sample` and populate it with your Firebase and API configurations. [cite: 10, 1138]
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install` / `pnpm install`). [cite: 1127]
4.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`. [cite: 1127]
5.  Build for production: `npm run build`. The output will be in `frontend/dist/`, which is then served by the backend Docker container. [cite: 1127, 176]

### 8.4. Whisper Batch Processor

1.  Set up environment variables in `whisper_batch/config_develop/.env.develop` or a production `.env` file, including `HF_AUTH_TOKEN`. [cite: 1926, 1925]
2.  Build the Docker image using `whisper_batch/whisper_batch.dockerfile`. [cite: 22] Example command: `docker build -t whisper .` [cite: 22]
3.  This component is designed to be run as a GCP Batch job or a standalone worker polling Firestore for jobs. The `main.py` script within `whisper_batch/app/` contains the worker loop. [cite: 23, 1883, 1916]

### 8.5. Local Development with Emulators

* The `tests/app/gcp_emulator_run.py` script can be used to start local Firestore and GCS emulators for development. [cite: 21, 144]
* Ensure Docker is installed and running for the GCS emulator. [cite: 104]
* Set `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` and `STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variables in your backend/batch applications to point to these local emulators. [cite: 63, 91]

## 9. Utility Scripts

* **`code_printer.py`**: A Python script to print the content of specified files or files within directories, with options for filtering by extension, name, recursion, and omitting files/folders based on gitignore-style patterns. [cite: 1, 25, 26, 33, 34]
* **`tree.py`**: A Python script to display a tree-like structure of a directory, with options to filter by file extension or name, and to exclude certain files/directories. [cite: 1, 161, 163, 164]
